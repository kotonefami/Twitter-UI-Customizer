For Firefox users, we recommend utilizing Firefox Browser Add-ons for automatic updates of TUIC.

For Chromium users, you have several options:

-   Chrome WebStore: Provides automatic updates, though the process can be slow.
-   Zip files: Require manual updates, but the changes can be implemented instantly.
-   Crx files: These may require some initial setup, but they offer immediate automatic updates.

Please choose the one you prefer!

## For Contributors

For detailed guidelines, please refer to [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

**We've transitioned to using pnpm as our package manager!**  
If you've been using yarn, you'll need to install pnpm, remove the `node_modules` directory, and then execute  
`pnpm i --frozen-lockfile`.

**With the adoption of Vite as our build tool, the debugging process has been updated!**  
For information on our build and debugging procedures, please refer to [docs/vite_build](./docs/vite_build.md).

These changes have been in effect since September 2, 2023.
